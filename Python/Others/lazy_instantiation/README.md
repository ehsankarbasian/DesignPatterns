## Proposed study order:

Better to study caching properties before lazy_instantiation.
<br>
it's usefull to lazy_instantiation
<br>

`static_cache.py`
<br>
`semi_dynamic_cache.py`
<br>
`dynamic_cache.py`
<br>
`cache_how_to_use.py`

Now you can study `lazy_instantiation.py` and implement your codes according to it.
